# mnimidamon-backend
Backend for _mnimidamon_ written in Go.


## Running

The _mnimidamon_ server can be started with this command:

``go run ./cmd/mnimidamon-server/main.go``

or build the executable and run it later:

``go build ./cmd/mnimidamon-server/main.go``

## OpenAPI code generation

The server uses HTTP communications to exchange JSON entities. The endpoints follow REST specifications
which are defined in `./public/spec/swagger.yml`. Client and Server communication code is generated by the
`go-swagger` toolkit. If the specifications change, run the following commands respectfully.

Generate endpoints code:

``swagger generate server -A mnimidamon -f ./public/spec/swagger.yaml -C swagger-layout.yml -t ./adapter/restapi -s endpoints -m modelap
i
``

Generate clients code:

``swagger generate client -A mnimidamon -f ./public/spec/swagger.yaml ``
